# Tableau UI Release Notes
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 2.2.1
### Fixes
- [#21](https://github.com/tableau/tableau-ui/issues/21): "TS Property '...' does not exist on type"
- `TextField`:
  - no longer reserves space for a label when `label` prop is `undefined`.
  - no longer shows an inner shadow in iOS Safari.
  - error label text is now 10px (was 9px).
  - clear button behavior is improved and alignment corrected.
- `Button`:
  - Kinds have been simplified to `primary`, `outline`, and `destructive`.
  - *Deprecated* kinds: `attentionRed`, `blackText`, `filled`, and `filledGreen`. For now these kinds are internally remapped to the new kind names, but will be removed in a future release. Please migrate per the jsdoc documentation.
- `DropdownSelect` border is now green when focused (matching `TextField`).
- Internally generated `id` attributes are now seeded rather than starting from 0.
- Corrected several documentation typos.

## 2.2.0
### Features
- [#15](https://github.com/tableau/tableau-ui/issues/15): Added `Stepper` Component

### Fixes
- [#20](https://github.com/tableau/tableau-ui/issues/20): `TextField` with numeric value 0 displays 0 above the input

## 2.1.0
### Features
- [#12](https://github.com/tableau/tableau-ui/issues/12): `Button`, `Checkbox`, `DropdownSelect`, `Pill`, `Radio`, `Spinner`, and `TextField` now properly [Forward Refs](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html).
  - Because `ref` was previously non-functional on these components, this change is considered additive rather than breaking.

## 2.0.2
### Fixes
- Added missing README.md to npm package

## 2.0.1
### Fixes

- `DropdownSelect` arrow icon will now remain when passing a `background` style override.
- Left-Justified Tabs can expand past their container
- [#11](https://github.com/tableau/tableau-ui/issues/11): `Pill` component is not being exported

## 2.0.0
### BREAKING
- Renamed `onChange` callback on `TabsProps` to `onTabChange` to avoid shadowing native HTML `onChange` event.
- When `aria-label` is provided on `TabsProps`, it is now applied to the root container rather than the tabs list.

### Features
- Added `Pill` Component

### Fixes
- Removed extraneous documentation for native props (e.g. `className`, `id`, `style`).
